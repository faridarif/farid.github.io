**Note: [Fundamental Routing Concepts - Routing (Concepts, Protocols and Configurations)](https://faridarif.github.io/posts/routing/)**

EIGRP is a Cisco-proprietary advanced distance-vector routing protocol. EIGRP falls under the category of advanced distance-vector protocols, but it's quite different from traditional distance-vector protocols such as RIP. EIGRP was created as a classless version of IGRP and ideal choice for large, multiprotocol (routed protocols) networks built primarily on Cisco routers. It's also considered a hybrid protocol because it incorporates features from both distance-vector and some of those of link-state protocols. EIGRP calculates routes based not only on the distance but also on additional factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. However, the fundamental operation of EIGRP is based on the principles of a distance-vector protocol. EIGRP maintains a topology table similar to a link-state database, which allows it to quickly adapt to changes in the network and converge efficiently.

**EIGRP distance-vector properties :**

- An EIGRP router only advertises its best route to its neighbor, not every route that it is aware of.
- An EIGRP router does not have a complete map of the topology; it is only aware of what its neighbor has told it (routing by rumour).

**EIGRP link-state properties :**

- An EIGRP router does form neighbor relationships.
- Triggered updates. An update is only sent when a change in the topology occurs.

**EIGRP Basic Features :**

- Protocol-Dependent Modules (PDMs) : EIGRP uses PDMs to support different routed protocols such as IPv4, IPv6, and legacy protocols IPX and AppleTalk.
- Authentication : EIGRP supports authentication to ensures that routers only accept routing information from other routers that have been configured with the same password or authentication information. However, authentication does not encrypt the EIGRP routing updates; it only provides a means of authenticating the source of those updates.

### EIGRP Packet Types

EIGRP uses various types of packets to exchange information and maintaining routing within the network. These packet types are crucial for neighbor discovery, route updates, and overall protocol operation.

- **Hello Packets** : Hello packets are used for neighbor discovery and to establish and maintain neighbor relationships. EIGRP routers send Hello packets to their directly connected neighbors at regular intervals. These packets help routers identify potential neighbors and form neighbor adjacencies.
- **Update Packets** : Update packets carry routing information between EIGRP routers. When a router has new or changed routing information, it sends Update packets to its neighbors to inform them about the updates. Update packets contain information about feasible routes and their metrics.
- **Query Packets** : Query packets are used in the EIGRP Query process, which helps the router find an alternative path when the primary path becomes unavailable. If a route's successor (best path) is lost, the router send Query packets to its neighbors to search for an alternative path. Neighboring routers respond with Reply packets if they have feasible successors.
- **Reply Packets** : Reply packets are responses to Query packets. When a router receives a Query packet and has a feasible successor for the affected route, it send a Reply packet back to the querying router. The Reply packet provides information about the feasible successor route.
- **Acknowledgement (ACK) Packets** : EIGRP uses ACK packets to acknowledge the receipt of Update, Query, and Reply packets. When a router receives one of these packets form a neighbor, it sends an ACP packet to confirm receipt. ACK packets ensure reliable packet delivery. In other words, ACK packets are "dataless" Hello packets during a "*reliable*" (for example, RTP) exchange.
- **SIA-Query (Stuck-in-Active Query) Packets** : SIA-Query packets are used in the SIA-Query process, which prevents the "*Stuck-in-Active*" condition. This condition can occur during topology changes when a router is waiting for replies to its Query packets but doesn't receive them. SIA-Query packets help routers retransmit the Query and avoid the Stuck-in-Active state.
- **SIA-Reply (Stuck-in-Active Reply) Packets** : SIA-Reply packets are responses to SIA-Query packets. They provide the necessary information to help a router exit the Stuck-in-Active state and resume normal operation.

## How It Works? EIGRP Operation

1) **EIGRP Initial Route Discovery**

EIGRP routers use **Hello packets** to discover neighboring routers. When a router receives a Hello packet from a potential neighbor, it verifies the sender's identity and establishes a neighbor relationship. The neighbor adjacency will only be established when both neighboring routers exchange Hello packet. After receiving an Hello packet, routers begin exchanging **Update packets** to share routing information. Each router populates its Topology Table with the routes and metrics provided by its neighbors. This Topology Table includes potential paths, their metrics, and information about the routers advertising those routes. Routers that received Update packets therefore reply with an **ACK packet** informing their neighbors that they have received the update. It is because EIGRP Update packets use reliable delivery.

For example, *Router-A* sends an Hello packets to *Router-B*. *Router-B* receives the Hello packet and adds *Router-A* to its neighbor table. *Router-B* then sends an Update packet that contains all routes it know, along with Hello packet to *Router-A*. *Router-A* updates its neighbor table (database) with *Router-B*. Both routers have exchanged Hello packets, the neighbor adjacency is established. *Router-A* adds all update entries from *Router-B* to its topology table. *Router-A* responds to *Router-B* with an ACK (acknowledgement) packet. *Router-A* send an Update packet to *Router-B* advertising the routes that it is aware of, except those learned from *Router-B* (Split Horizon technique). *Router-B* receives the Update packet and adds all update entries from *Router-A* to its topology table. *Router-B* responds to *Router-A* with an ACK packet.

2) **EIGRP Metrics**

A metric is a numerical value that represents the "*cost*" of using a particular route, or attributes or characteristics of that route. The lowest metric value indicates the best route.  EIGRP's metric is a composite value calculated using a formula and based on various factors :

- **Bandwidth (most important)** : This represent the available bandwidth of the link and measured in kilobit per second (Kbps). **Higher bandwidth** results in a lower metric (best route).
- **Delay (most important)** : Delay represents the time it takes for a packet to traverse the link and measured in microseconds (usec). **Lower delay** values lead to lower metrics (best route).
- **Reliability (optional)** : Reliability is a measure of link stability, ranging from 0 (least reliable) to 255 (most reliable). More reliable links have lower metric (best route).
- **Load (optional)** : Load refers to the link's current traffic load as a fraction of 255 (255/255 is completely saturated). Lower load values result in lower metric (best route). `txload` is transmit load and `rxload` is receive load.

These information can be seen using the command :
```bash
Router# show interface <interface-id>
```
![DTP Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faridarif/faridarif.github.io/master/pictures/show-interface.png){:.align-center}

Default Composite Formula :
```python
Metric = [K1 * Bandwidth + K3 * Delay] * 256
```

Complete Composite Formula :
```python
Metric = [K1 * Bandwidth + (K2 * Bandwidth) / (256 - Load) + K3 * Delay] * [K5 / (Reliability + K4)]
```

- **Bandwidth and Delay Constants (K1 and K3)** : These are user-configurable constants that allow network administrators to adjust the importance of bandwidth and delay in the metric calculation.
- **Load and Reliability Constants (K2 and K4)** : Similar to the bandwidth and delay constants, these constants let administrators adjust the impact of load and reliability on the metric.
- **Constants (K5 and K6)** : These constants are set to 1 by default and are used to give reliability and load factors the same weight as bandwidth and delay. They can be adjusted if needed.

3) **DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm)**

EIGRP routers uses Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to provide the best and backup routes to each destination. DUAL uses several terms :

![DTP Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faridarif/faridarif.github.io/master/pictures/DUAL-Terms.png){:.align-center}

The best routes were chosen with the lowest Feasible Distance (FD, also known as "*metric*"). The "*lowest FD*" refers to the lowest cumulative metric among the available paths to reach that destination. This ensures that the chosen path is the most optimal in terms of the combined metric factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. 

DUAL converges quickly because it can use backup routes known as Feasible Successors (FSs). If the primary route (Successor) becomes unavailable, the router enters the Query process. It sends **Query packets** to its neighbors to find an alternative path (FS). Neighboring routers receiving Query packets respond with **Reply packets** containing information about itself (candidate of Feasible Successors). The querying router uses this information to identify potential backup routes.

4) **Topology Table**

Topology table stores the following information required by DUA to calculate distances and vectors to destinations :

- **Reported Distance (RD)** : The metric that each neighbor advertises for each destination.
- **Feasible Distance (FD)** : The metric that the router would use to reach the destination via its neighbor.

## EIGRP Classic Configurations (IPv4)

1) Initialize EIGRP routing process and enter the EIGRP classic configuration mode :

- AS number functions as a process ID. The AS number used for EIGRP configuration is only significant to the EIGRP routing domain.
- AS number configured in a router must be the same as the neighbor's AS number.

```bash
Router(config)# router eigrp <autonomous-system-number>
```

2) Set the EIGRP Router-ID for a router :

- Router-ID is used to uniquely identify each router in the EIGRP routing domain.
- Router-ID is in IP address format, which is four decimal numbers separated by dots. For example, 2.2.2.2

```bash
Router(config-router)# eigrp router-id 2.2.2.2
```

3) Enable EIGRP routing on a specific interface port with an IP network and advertise it :

 - "*network*" statement identifies the interface to enable EIGRP on, and it adds the interface's connected network to the EIGRP topology table. EIGRP then advertises the topology table to other routers in the EIGRP autonomous system. In other words, it defines the networks to be advertised.
 - Wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. To calculate a wildcard mask, subtract the network subnet mask from the broadcast subnet mask (IP Addressing and Subnetting topic).

```bash
Router(config-router)# network <network-address> <wildcard-mask>
```

4) Suppress routing updates on an interface :

- Passive interfaces prevent EIGRP routing updates out a specified router interface.

```bash
Router(config-router)# passive-interface <interface-id>
```

### Verify EIGRP Configuration (IPv4)

Verifying EIGRP configuration is an important step to ensure that the protocol is functioning as intended.

1) Display information about EIGRP-enabled interfaces :

```bash
Router# show ip eigrp interfaces
```

2) Shows the list of neighboring routers that a router has established EIGRP adjacencies with :

```bash
Router# show ip eigrp neighbors
```

3) Displays detailed information about the routing table entries for EIGRP :

```bash
Router# show ip eigrp topology
```

4) Displays the IP routing table :

```bash
Router# show ip route
```
