**Note: This blog post explains the fundamental routing concepts and basic configurations of IPv4 routing. The IPv6 routing configuration will be explained in another blog post - IPv6 Routing Configurations (Static & Dynamic Routing). Before diving into the intricacies of routing, it's important to have a solid understanding of some fundamental networking concepts including : Network Devices, Network Topologies, IP Addressing and Subnetting, OSI Model, and Switching. These concepts provide the foundational knowledge that will help you grasp routing topics effectively.**

Routing is the process of **directing data packets** from a source to a destination **across a network** or series of **interconnected networks**. In simpler terms, routing can be thought of as **finding the best path** for data to travel through a network in order to reach its intended destination. Routing involves **making decisions based on various factors**, such as network topology, link conditions, and routing protocols. A **routing table** is used to determine the most efficient path to reach the destination. These decisions are typically managed by specialized devices called **routers**, which examine the destination address of a data packet and determine where to forward it next in order to reach its final destination. A router is a specialized computer and requires the same components to operate as computers. Routers have specialized ports and network interface cards to interconnect devices to other networks. Routers can have various types of ports, each serving a specific function in network communication and management.

- **Ethernet Ports (LAN Ports)** : These ports are used to connect devices within the same local network (LAN) using Ethernet cables. They provide high-speed data transfer between devices and are labeled as FastEthernet (10/100 Mbps) or GigabitEthernet (1 Gbps) ports.
- **WAN Port** : The Wide Area Network (WAN) port is used to connect the router to an external network, such as the internet or a corporate network.
- **Serial Ports** : Serial ports (such as RS-232 or RS-485) are used for connecting to legacy devices and equipment that use serial communication protocols.
- **Auxiliary Port** : The auxiliary port is often used for out-of-band management and remote access to the router.
- **Console Port** : The console port is used for direct local management and configuration of the router via a serial connection.
- **RJ-45 Console Port** : In addition to the traditional serial console port, Cisco routers may have a modem RJ-45 console port for console management.
- **Management Ports** : Some routers may have dedicated management ports for remote access and management.
- **USB Ports** : USB ports on routers serve various purposes, including connecting USB storage devices for file sharing and firmware updates.
- **Fiber Ports** : Some routers feature fiber-optic ports for connecting to high-speed fiber networks.
- **PoE (Power over Ethernet) Ports** : Some routers offer PoE ports that provide both data connectivity and electrical power to devices like IP phone, camera, and access points.

### How Does Data Flow in Routers?

The process begins when a device, such as computer or a server, generates data that needs to be sent to another device over a network. This data is divided into smaller units called data packets. Each data packet is given a source and a destination address. These addresses are typically represented as IP addresses. The source device sends the data packet to its default gateway, which is usually the router that connects the local networks (LAN) to the wider network (WAN). The router examines the destination IP address of the data packet. The router consults its routing table, which contains information about various network paths and their associated costs. The routing table helps the router determine the best path for forwarding the data packet toward the destination. Based on the routing table, the router determines the next hop, which is the next router that the data packet should be sent to, using the appropriate outgoing interface (*this router is chosen because it is closer to the destination or has more direct connection*). **If the destination IP address does not belong to a connected network or is in the routing table, the packet is sent to Gateway of Last Resort (default route - more details in *Static Routing* section)**. The data packet travels from router to router, hopping through the network, following the path determined by the routing decisions. The destination router delivers the packet to the destination device based on the internal addressing of the local network. **If the original data was divided into multiple packets, the destination device reassemble the packets in the correct order to reconstruct the original data**.

## Routed Protocol VS Routing Protocol

Routed protocols and routing protocols are two different concepts in computer networking.

### Routed Protocols

A routed protocol is a set of rules and conventions used to **format** and **process** data packets for transmission between devices on a network. These protocols define **how data is structured**, **addressed**, and **encapsulated** into packets before being sent across the network. Routed protocols are responsible for determining the **logical addressing scheme** used to **identify** devices and their locations within a network. Examples of routed protocols include :

- **Internet Protocol (IP)** : The most common routed protocol used on the internet and many private networks. It provide unique IP addresses to devices and enables them to communicate across networks.
- **IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange)** : Used in Novell NetWare networks.
- **AppleTalk** : Used in Apple networks.

**Routed protocols focus on the format and addressing of data packets (how data is organized and addressed), ensuring that data can be properly routed between devices within a network or across interconnected networks**.

### Routing Protocols

Routing protocols are a set of rules and algorithms used by routers to **determine the optimal path for forwarding data packets** from a source to a destination. These protocols allow router to exchange information about network topology, reachability, and metrics (such as link cost or bandwidth) with each other. By sharing this information, routers collectively build and update their outing tables, which contain information about available network paths. Routing protocols all into two main categories :

- **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)** : These protocols are used within a single autonomous system (AS) or network. Example includes :
	- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
	- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
	- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

- **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)** : These protocols are used to exchange outing information between different autonomous systems. Examples includes :
	- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) - Most widely used EGP on the internet.

**Routing protocols focus on how routers exchange information and make decisions about forwarding data**.

## Static Routing

Static routing is a networking configuration in which network administrators **manually specify** the paths that data packets should take to reach their destinations. In static, the routing decisions are **predetermined** and do not change unless the administrator manually updates the routing table. Static routing is often used in scenarios where network topologies are **simple** and **stable**, and where **specific routing paths** need to be enforced for security or performance reasons.

- **Directly Connected Network** : A directly connected network refers to a network segment that is physically attached to a router's interface. In other words, it's a network that can be reached by the router without the need for additional hops through other routers.
- **Remote Network** : A remote network refers to a network segment that is not directly connected to the router where the routing decision is being made. In other words, a remote network is a destination network that is located beyond the immediate neighbors of the router.

### Configuring Recursive Static Route

A recursive static route is a type of static route that **specifies** the **next-hop router's IP address** to reach a destination network. Recursive static route is a static route that **forwarding packets** to the **next hop**. 

For example, we are now configuring *Router-1*, and the next-hop router is *Router-2* :

- **network-address** : Destination network address of the remote network to be added to the routing table.
- **subnet-mask** : Subnet mask of the remote network to be added to the routing table.
- **ip-address** : The next-hop router's IP address. For example, *172.16.5.1*.

```bash
Router-1(config)# ip route <network-address> <subnet-mask> <ip-address>
```

### Configuring Directly Attached Static Route

A directly attached static route is a type of static route that **forwarding packets** to the **exit interface**. Directly attached static route **specifies** the **next-hop router's interface directly connected to the destination network**.

For example, we are now configuring *Router-1*, and the next-hop router is *Router-2* :

- **network-address** : Destination network address of the remote network to be added to the routing table.
- **subnet-mask** : Subnet mask of the remote network to be added to the routing table.
- **exit-interface** : The outgoing interface to forward packets to the destination network (one of the router's own interfaces that is directly connected to the destination network). For example, *Serial 0/0/0* or *GigabitEthernet 0/1*.

```bash
Router-1(config)# ip route <network-address> <subnet-mask> <exit-interface>
```

![Exit Interfacel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faridarif/faridarif.github.io/master/pictures/exit-interface.png){:.align-center}

### Fully Specified Static Route

- Both the exit interface and the next-hop router's IP address are specified.
- When the exit interface is an Ethernet network, a fully specified static route is used.

```bash
Router(config)# ip route <network-address> <subnet-mask> <exit-interface> <ip-address>
```

### Configuring Default Static Route

A default static route (or default route) is a special type of static route used to define a path that a router should take when it need to forward data packets to **any destination** that is **not explicitly listed** in its **routing table**. Instead of dropping the packet or generating on error, the router forwards the packet to the next-hop specified in the default route. The default route uses no specific network address and network subnet mask; instead, it uses a wildcard address. Default static route are commonly used :

- To route traffic from a **local network** to the **internet**.
- To route traffic from **stub router** (a router with **only one upstream** neighbor router) or **stub network** (a network that has **only one route** to reach other networks).

In Cisco IOS terminology, the default route is often referred to as the "*gateway of las resort*". It's the route that a router uses when it doesn't know how to reach  a specific destination. A default route ensures that data packets are **not dropped** when a router doesn't have a specific route for a destination.

- **0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0** : This is a wildcard address that matches any destination IP address and network address.
- **ip-address / exit-interface** : A default route can use either a next-hop router's IP address or an exit interface as its next-hop specification.

```bash
Router(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <ip-address/exit-interface>
```

### Verify a Static Route

The routing table displays information about the available routes, including their destination networks, next-hop addresses, metrics, and administrative distances.

This command shows the IPv4 routing table :

- "S" indicates static route.
- "S*"  indicates default route and "/0" mask indicates none of the bits are required to match.

```bash
Router# show ip route
```

## Dynamic Routing

A dynamic routing protocol is a set of rules and algorithms that allow routers within a network to **automatically exchange information** about **network topology**, **reachability**, and other **routing-related data**. Dynamic routing protocols can scale to accommodate **large and complex networks**. The purpose of dynamic routing protocols :

- Dynamically discover and adapt to changes in the network (such as link failures, congestion, or new routes).
- Ability to find a new best path if the current path is no longer available.
- Maintaining up-to-date routing information.

Dynamic routing protocols allow routers to **discover** and **learn** about the **presence of other routers** and **networks** in the same network domain. When network topology changes occur, such as a link failure or the addition of new devices, dynamic routing protocols **automatically adjust** the **routing tables** to reflect the changes. Dynamic routing protocols use **various metrics** (such as link cost, bandwidth, delay, etc.) to **calculate the best paths** for data packets based on **real-time** network conditions. Dynamic routing protocols **continuously exchange updates** and **information** about network changes.

- Autonomous System (AS) refers to a set of routers and networks that operates **under a single administrative domain** and share a **consistent routing policy**. It represents a logical unit within the global internet. Each Autonomous System is assigned a unique identifier called an Autonomous System number (ASN). ASNs are used to distinguish and identify individual ASes in the routing system. In other words, an AS represents a network domain under a single administrative control with a consistent routing policy.

Dynamic routing protocols are categorized into two main groups with different routing algorithms based on the scope of their operation and the are of the network they cover.

### Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)

Interior Gateway Protocols are routing protocols that operate **within** a **single autonomous system (AS)**. IGPs are used to exchange routing information and make routing decisions within the boundaries of a single AS. There are two different routing algorithms in IGPs :

1)  **Distance Vector**

Distance Vector protocols use the concept of distance (often measured in terms of hop count) to determine the best path to a destination. Distance Vector is a routing algorithm that operates by sharing routing information between routers based on the distance or metric to reach various destination networks. It's one of the fundamental routing algorithms used in computer networks. 

Each router starts with information its directly connected networks. These networks are considered reachable with a cost of zero (or one hop). Periodically, routers exchange routing updates with their directly connected neighbors. These updates contain information about the routes known by each router and their associated costs (hop count). The updates can be triggered by changes in the network, such as new links coming up, link failures, or based on a regular time interval. Upon receiving a routing update, a router calculate the total cost to reach each destination network. This cost is the sum of the cost in the received update and the cost to reach the advertising router. For example, if *Router-A* receives an update from *Router-B* indicating a cost of 3 to reach *Network-X*, and the cost from *Router-A* to *Router-B* is 2, then the total cost from *Router-A* to *Network-X* is 2 + 3 = 5. So from *Router-A*, the destination of *Network-X* with an address of 192.168.11.0 (for example) is in the direction of *Router-B* and with a cost of 5. Distance vector protocols often use techniques like "*Split Horizon*" and "*Poison Reverse*" to prevent routing loops. Split Horizon prevents a router from advertising a route back to the neighbor from which it learned that route. Poison Reverse advertises an infinite metric (usually 16 or "*unreachable*") to inform neighbors about a failed route. To prevent loops, distance vector protocols often employ mechanisms like hop count limits or split horizon to ensure that incorrect information does not propagate indefinitely. 

Distance vector routing protocol as an analogy, similar to a sign board. If we want to go to Kuala Lumpur from Pahang and we don't have a map, we must rely on the sign board. If the sign board tells us that Kuala Lumpur is in the West direction and 100 km away (<- Kuala Lumpur 100 km), that distance and direction are **not always true**.

- **RIP(Routing Information Protocol)** : RIP is a classic example of a distance-vector protocol. It uses hop count as the metric and employs a maximum hop count limit to prevent routing loops. RIPv2 introduces subnet support and some improvements over the original RIP. It's suitable for small to medium-sized networks.
- **IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** : IGRP is a Cisco-proprietary distance-vector which means it is implemented only by Cisco routers. It's less commonly used today in favor of newer protocols. IGRP has been superseded by EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol),which is also a Cisco proprietary protocol.
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** : EIGRP is sometimes referred to as a hybrid routing protocol because it has characteristics of distance vector and **some** of those of a link-state protocols. **However, the fundamental operation of EIGRP is based on the principles of a distance-vector protocol**. (We will discuss more in EIGRP topics)

2) **Link-State**

Link-State protocols focus on sharing information about the state of links (connections) in the network. Routers in a link-state protocol exchange link-state advertisements (LSAs) to build a comprehensive view of the network topology.

Routers form and maintain or dynamically discover neighbor relationships by sending out "*Hello Messages*" or "*Hello Packet*" (two-way communication) using multicast or unicast addresses. Each router shares information about itself (all the interfaces information such as IP addresses of the interfaces and the status of that interface, either *UP* or *DOWN*) with its neighbor. That neighbor router will make a copy of that information and pass it on to another router (its neighbor) along with information about itself. So all routers will have each other's interface information. This called LSA (Link State Advertisement). The network will be flooded with LSA. Link-State protocols use sequence number to uniquely identify LSAs. This helps prevent the reintroduction of outdated or duplicate information. Routers generate LSA periodically or in response to network changes. All routers in the network (or area) will have their own topological database (or maps) which contains information about each router, links, and associated costs or metrics in the network. To calculate the best path to the destination, the router will use the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, also called Dijkstra algorithm. SPF algorithm is determined based on the accumulated cost or metric associated with the links or routers in the path. Each router in the network may have a different path to the destination based on the calculation made by SPF algorithm. The best path will be put into the routing table of the router. Link-State routing protocols are fast convergent (changes reported immediately). Link-state protocols have a full view of the path to get to a destination network. In other word, it has a full "*road map*" of the network or area. 

Link : Router interfaces
State : Description of an interface and its relationship to neighboring routers

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** : OSPF is a well-known link-state protocol that uses a cost metric (often based on bandwidth) to calculate the shortest path. OSPF is suitable in multivendor environments. (We will discuss more in OSPF topics)
- **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)** : IS-IS is similar to OSPF but is often used in service provider environments. It uses a link-state database and a metric known as "*metric-style*", which is used to calculate the best path.

### Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)

Exterior Gateway Protocols are routing protocols that operate **between different autonomous systems (ASes)**. They are used to exchange information an make routing decisions **between separate administrative domains**. EGPs are generally associated with the use of the Path Vector routing algorithm.

1) **Path Vector**

Path Vector protocols are a variation of the distance-vector approach. They track the path taken by a packet through a sequence of autonomous systems and use this information to make routing decisions.

Each router starts with information about its own locally connected networks and their associated attributes. This initial information forms the basis for generating routing updates. When a route advertises a route to a neighboring autonomous system (AS), it includes a list of ASes that the route has traversed. This list is known as the "*path vector*". The path vector provides a sequence of autonomous systems that the route has passed through, creating a record of the route's path. Routers in different ASes exchange routing updates that include route prefixes (destination networks) along with their respective *path vector*. Routers can compare the *path vectors* in received updates with their own *path vectors* for the same route. If a router receives and update with a *path vector* that contains it own AS, it knows that the route has come full circle and is looping. The router can then discard the update to avoid the loop. The path vector algorithm allows network administrators to influence route selection based on policies and attributes. Routers can consider attributes such as AS path length, route preference, route origin, and other policy-based factors when deciding which route to select from multiple updates. Path vectors are often used in conjunction with route aggregation, where multiple prefixes are summarized into a single advertisement. Aggregation helps reduce the size of routing updates and improves scalability.

- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** : BGP is the most well-known path vector protocol used on the internet for interdomain routing. BGP exchanges path vectors (route) between autonomous systems and supports complex routing policies.

### Administrative Distance

 Administrative Distance (AD) is a concept used in routing protocols to determine the trustworthiness or preference of a particular route when multiple routing sources provide conflicting routing information for the same destination network. It is a numerical value assigned to each routing source or protocol, indicating its credibility in providing routing information. A lower administrative distance value indicates a higher priority for the corresponding routing source. AD value associated with a particular route can often be seen in the routing table. Examples of AD values :

-  0     : Directly Connected Interface
- 1     : Static Route
- 20   : eBGP (External BGP)
- 90   : EIGRP
- 110 : OSPF
- 120 : RIP
- 200 : iBGP (Internal BGP)

Administrative Distance is only be used to determine the best route when there is two or more routes with same destination network subnets. If the destination network subnets is different, both route will be added to routing table.
